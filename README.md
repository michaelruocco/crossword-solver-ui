# Crossword solver API

Crossword solver API

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will run the front end locally, but will expect the backend api
to be available on `http://localhost:8080`.

## TODO

- Update local proxy config to enable overriding default local backend url with value supplied from an environment variable
- Add answer validation to ensure matches pattern and add handling in UI for not correct
- Improve answer input to match any crossing characters if there are any rather than being free text input
